### Two step tuning procedure
- step 1: obtain a first or second order model using half rule.
- step 2: start from first order create PI. start from second order create PID controller

#### step 1
use half rule for the approximation of effective delay: the largest neglected time constant is distributed evenly to the effective delay and the smallest remaining time constant.

positive numerator time constants can be canceled out with negative poles according to some rules.

#### step 2
consider the closed loop response of a system. assuming a desired closed loop response and substituing process model. one can calculate controller.

### remarks:
- lag dominant process \ta_i > 8 * \teta can be approximated by pure integrator.
- consider tylor expansion of time delay:  
e^{-\teta s} = 1-\teta s , e^{-\teta s} = 1/(1 + \teta s)
  - an inverse response time constant could be approximated by time delay
  - a small lag time constant could be approximated by time delay
- dominant secound order dynamic is when (\ta_2 > \teta)
