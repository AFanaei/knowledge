### remarks
this paper uses the following method for controlling unstable systems:
- the parameters of unstable process (first order plus dead time with unstable root) should be identified using relay feedback method (Park et al 1997 - Improved relay autotuning with static load disturbance)
- first a controller added to the model and k_c is increased to bring the closed loop system to the verge of unstability there we have: 
`GM = 1 & PM = -\pi` from this k_cu & w_u ultimate gain and ultimate frequency could be measured and used to find process params
- then the open loop niquest is written for `G_OL=k_cu * G_p(s)` we should have:
  -  `Re(G_ol(jw)) < -1 @ w=0`
  -  `Re(G_ol(jw)) > -1 @ w=w_u`
  -  `Im(G_ol(jw)) = 0 @ w=w_u`
- using the above conditoins the `k_min` and `k_max` limits of control gain could be calculated. and we select `k_cu=sqrt(k_min * k_max)`
- using the proportional controller the closed loop response becomes of a form that can be later converted into second order plus dead time using either taylor expansion or model reduction.
- various rules are presented for designin PID controlers for such systems.
