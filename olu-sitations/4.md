### remarks
in this paper a controller is desined using IMC.
- first the process model is divided into minimum phase and non-minimum phase.
- If the process model G has unstable poles q should have zeros at those poles.
- If the process model G_D has unstable poles (1-Gq) should have zeros at those poles.
- then `q=p^-1 * f` where P^-1 is inverse of model and f is a filter, this filter could be consists of two part f_s to make controller proper and f_d to cancel the unstable poles or stable poles near zero of G_D.
- a set point filter could be added to prevent set-point kick off problem.
- classical control transfer function could be calculated from IMC controller using `G_c = q/(1-Gq)` where q is IMC controller and G is process model.
- then the only problem is to derive PID parameters from generated G_c. this could be done using taylor expansion of G_c up to three terms.
- the FODUP is stable only if `0 < (\teta / \ta) < 2`, it is not stable if \teta / \ta > 2! its good case for study.
