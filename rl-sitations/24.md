#### [Dota 2 1v1](https://www.alexirpan.com/2017/08/12/openai-dota-2.html) and [5v5](https://www.alexirpan.com/2018/06/27/dota-2-five.html)
It could even be using the system from the [Learning from Human Preferences](https://openai.com/blog/deep-reinforcement-learning-from-human-preferences/) paper - I could see it being useful for given partial signal to behaviors that are hard to define.
Speaking of saying “screw it” and doing the thing that will clearly scale, it’s interesting that plain PPO is just good enough so far. I’m most surprised by the time horizon problem. The partial observability hurts, but empirically it was doable for the Dota 1v1 bot. The high dimensional action / observation space didn’t feel like obstacles to me - they looked annoying but didn’t look impassable. But the long time horizons problem felt hard enough that I expected it to require something besides just PPO.

This seems to have parallels to the Retro Contest results, where the winning entries were just tuned versions of PPO and Rainbow DQN. In the past, I’ve been skeptical of the “hardware hypothesis”, where the only thing stopping AI progress is faster computers. At the time, I said I thought the split in AI capabilities was about 50-50 between hardware and software. I’m starting to lean towards the hardware side, updating towards something like 60-40 for hardware vs software. There are an increasing number of results where baseline algorithms just work if you try them at the right scale, enough that I can’t ignore them.

Learning algorithm: Probably [PPO](https://openai.com/blog/openai-baselines-ppo/). It works well, and it supports continuous control, which may be a better fit for mouse movement.

#### [The Friendship Paradox And You](https://www.alexirpan.com/2017/09/13/friendship-paradox.html)
**not related to RL but a fun post to read.**

Well, for one, it’s great for addressing imposter syndrome issues. For example, sometimes I feel like I should be writing more. When I poke at the feeling, it often turns into this.

1. I should write more.
2. Why do I think that? It’s partly because I read cool things from people that write more than I do.
3. But by friendship paradox, it’s expected that those writers are writing more than me.
4. So hey, maybe I shouldn’t feel too bad.

More importantly, the friendship paradox touches on another, more important idea: the things you see don’t have to reflect reality. If you base your assumptions of popularity on the popularity of your friends, on average you’ll come up short. If you base your assumptions of productivity by things you read online, it’s easier to see evidence of productivity from people who are very productive. If you base your views of somebody by things you hear them say, it’s warped by the chances you would have heard their views in the first place. And so on down.
