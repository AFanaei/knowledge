### why is this paper good
Training algorithm is backed up by theory. In deep learning, not all theory-justified papers have good empirical results, but theory-justified papers with good empirical results have really good empirical results. For those papers, itâ€™s very important to understand their theory, because the theory usually explains why they perform so much better.

There is an argument that GANs have close connections to actor-critic reinforcement learning. (See [Pfau & Vinyals 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.01945).) so we should probably keep an eye on GAN papers anyways.
